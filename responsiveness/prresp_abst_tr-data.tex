This paper shows that Data Center TCP (DCTCP) introduces unnecessary lag
equivalent to 1.5--2 RTTs, due to the way it processes congestion feedback. A
per-ACK moving average is proposed that cuts out 1 RTT of this lag.
Paradoxically, the rest of the lag is reduced by spreading the congestion
response over a round. The EWMA still inherently smooths over the same set
number of round trips, even though it is clocked per-ACK.
