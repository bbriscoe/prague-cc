This report motivates and defines an improvement to the responsiveness of the Data 
Center TCP (DCTCP) algorithm.
It explains how DCTCP introduces unnecessary lag
equivalent to 1.5--2 RTTs, due to the way it processes congestion feedback. A
per-ACK moving average is proposed that cuts out 1 RTT of this lag.
Paradoxically, the rest of the lag is reduced by spreading the congestion
response over a round. The EWMA is designed to still smooth over the same set
number of round trips, even though it is clocked per-ACK. 
This version is released prior to full evaluation in order to elicit early feedback on the design. % ToDo: update last sentence when evaluation done.
