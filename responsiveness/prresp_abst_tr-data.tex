This report explains how DCTCP introduces 1--2 rounds of unnecessary lag, due to
the way it processes congestion feedback. To solve this, a per-ACK moving
average is proposed. It always cuts out 1 RTT of this lag and, paradoxically, it
cuts out most of the rest of the lag by spreading the congestion response over a
round. The EWMA still averages out variations in the feedback signal over the
same set number of round trips, even though it is clocked per-ACK. This version
of the report is released prior to full evaluation, in order to elicit early
feedback on the design.
% ToDo: update last sentence when evaluation done.
