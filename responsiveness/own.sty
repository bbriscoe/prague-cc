%% This next bit has been commented out
%% --- bibdb.ini has been changed from \Href to \url instead
%% --- also \href{}{} can be used in .bib files,
%% but BiBdb only notices the first item in its .ini file, so these don't
%% get rendered as hyperlinks in BiBdB --- they're fine in the .PDF though.

% Synonym for \url -------------------------------------------------------
%
% wBiBdb uses \Href (note the capitalisation) for Web hyperlink capability
%  so I use \Href in my .bib files.
% \url cannot support different anchor text from the URL,
% \href{}{} from hyperref.sty can;
% \Href{}[] in wBiBdb can too, but the syntax is incompatible with LateX;
%  so I've just defined a simple synonym with no optional argument.
%\newcommand*{\Href}[1]{\url{#1}}
